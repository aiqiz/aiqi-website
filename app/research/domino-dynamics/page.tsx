            <P>The domino chain effect serves as a a prototypical marginally stable system, where a sufficient force applied to a single element in the chain initiates the the successive toppling of the dominoes.</P>
            <P>Simplified models, like massless rods, single elastic/inelastic collisions, and relative sliding have been proposed and discussed, however, experimental validation remains limited. This study refines the use of high-speed video and computer vision techniques to analyze the domino effect.</P>
            <P>Initial 2D analysis revealed multi-collision effects and enabled examination of the domino wave's acceleration stage before reaching a plateau of propagation speed. However, this method failed to capture out-of-plane block rotations, shown by Youtuber Smarter Every Day below, which exhibit a periodic influence on propagation speed, highlighting an overlooked aspect of the chain's dynamics.</P>

            <P>We observe differences in the velocity curves (Figure 4) when varying domino spacing (e.g., *3 indicates spacing equal to three block widths). However, these velocities represent only the initial toppling phase and do not capture the system once domino transmission reaches a stable stage.</P>
            <P>The 2D reconstruction pipeline relies on several simplifying assumptions: it assumes no relative sliding, fixes each block's lower-right edge, and ignores both off-plane rotations and near-edge camera distortion. The field of view also limits tracking to roughly 20 dominoes, restricting the scale of analysis. These assumptions deviate from real-world dynamics, where sliding and rotations are present. To address these limitations, a 3D extraction framework has been introduced.</P>

            <P>The reconstruction error averages around Â±3[mm]. However, systematic errors in color marker tracking remain difficult to verify. To address this, we are setting up a global reference anchor system (similar to those used in 3D printing).</P>
            <P>While the designed pipeline theoretically captures full degrees of freedom, it still shows depth estimation uncertainty. As seen in the 3D model, marker trajectories are consistently over-slanted, suggesting a depth bias. This likely results from the use of only six co-planar markers, as well as imprecise calibration and world anchor frame setup. To address this, we plan to introduce front-facing markers to improve depth referencing and establish a more robust reference frame system.</P>

Rotation Ïy and sliding vx along the toppling direction dominate the motion, but wobbling and sliding in other directions remain non-negligible. The observed wobble arises from asymmetric collision points between adjacent domino blocks.</P>

With single-block motion already analyzed, future work will expand to multiple blocks and entire chains.</P>
